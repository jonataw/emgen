# Emgen

Emgen allows you to easily generate HTML email templates. Features include:

- **Automatic stylesheet inlining**: Write your CSS (or [Sass/Less/Stylus](https://jonataw.github.io/emgen/css-preprocessors)) in a separate file and Emgen will automatically inline it into your HTML.
- **File inclusion**: Allows you to reuse common elements of your templates by keeping them in separate fields and referring to them with a comment.
- [**Support for Vue templates**](https://jonataw.github.io/emgen/usage-vue): Use Vue.js to create your templates.
